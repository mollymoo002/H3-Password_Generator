# H3-Password_Generator
## Description
This web page allows a user to generate a random password to use and they can also choose what criteria the password must have. This is a useful tool when you cannot think of a secure password and just want a random one for a log in. Having the password need at least 8 characters and making it random makes the password more secure against any hacking attempts. This was a JavaScript-heavy project and I learned a lot about if statements, for loops, and the .length property.
## Usage
Please open the page link and follow the web prompts from there. If you want to generate a new password, please refresh the page.
